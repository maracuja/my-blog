About a year ago I noticed an app on my Apple TV called KORTV which hilariously promises to deliver "the best of Korean TV ... legeally!" As I'm learning Korean to better understand my wife's familly I took a punt and discovered a show called 냉장고를 부탁해 which roughly translates to "Please take care of my fridge".

It's a bit like the old day-time favourite _Ready, Steady, Cook_ in that the chefs have 15 minutes to make something that the guests have brought in. The Korean version differs in that the guests are famous (Korean) celebrities and they are being invited on the show so we all get a chance to peer into their fridges. The chefs then cook something with the contents.

It's fascinating because a lot of these celebrities do a lot of touring around Asia and also receive a lot of gifts from fans so the fridges tend to have lots of weird and wonderful ingredients from all over Asia which I guarantee you will have never seen before.

You end up getting this great insight into the day to day things that not only Koreans eat, but Chinese and Japanese folks eat as the guests and chefs discuss anecdotes and uses of the ingredients.

I'm only telling you this because a lot of posts will be about recipes in the show ha ha. You can see most of the episodes here [Kshowonline Edpisode Guide](http://kshowonline.com/category/155/please-take-care-of-my-refrigerator) they have been translated into English or you can catch in on KORTV (without subtitles!)
