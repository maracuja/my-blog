Doenjang Jjigae is the Korean version of the well-known Japanese side dish Miso Soup™. Unlike it's Japanese counterpart, Korean Miso Soup is a bit more substantial and meant to be eaten as part of a meal.

## Ingredients
- Doenjang / Korean Miso Paste
- Bunch of spring onions
- An onion
- A Courgette
- A Potato
- Block of Tofu
- Some deep-fried tofu (if you have any)

(i know in the picture it has a load of celery in it, don't do that - i was at my parents house struggling for ingredients ha ha)

## Method!
Basically dice the tofu and vegetables then put into a pot. Get a big tablespoon of doenjang and drop it in the pot. Cover with water, boil till everything is soft and also make sure the doenjang has disolved. OR Boil the hell out of it indefinitely until your friends or family demand to eat as my wife does.
