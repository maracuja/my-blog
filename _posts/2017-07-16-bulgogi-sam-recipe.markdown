As part of my annual posting ritual, I thought I'd explain something quick and super amazing for barbecues which is SSAM. Ssam is basically three things: - Meat, lettuce and sauce (and rice and garlic and maybe kimchi)

First thing you need to do is get some beef and marinate it in some kind of soy sauce for about 24 hours. The beef in these pics is Rib Eye steak nyom nyom nyom, this is how you make the marinade

## The Marinade Ingredients
- 330ml dark soy sauce
- Table spoon of korean chilli paste 고추장
- Can of Pepsi
- bunch of chopped spring onions / scallions
- a chopped onion
- couple of cloves of chopped garlic

All I'm going to say on the Pepsi is - my wife looked at the marinade, said it was a "complete disaster", but after eating said "omg amazing" - I rest my case.

Anyway you mix it all up in a bowl, stick the steak in it too and leave till tomorrow. If you live in the UK it's a good idea to pray for good weather for the next day's BBQ.

It should look something like this when you're done

## Ssam Ingredients

OK it's really simple - I'll assume you know how to BBQ meat, but you just need a couple of
things to make this into Ssam before the BBQ so that when the meat is ready you can eat
straight away. You will need the following: -
- A couple of lettuces worth of leaves (large cos works best)
- Bowl of rice
- Some korean chilli paste 고추장
- Sesame leaves if you have them
- Kimchi if you have any

## Method!

1. Get the lettuce leaf in your hand
2. Stick a blob of rice in the middle of the leaf
3. Put a splodge of chilli sauce on the rice
4. Whack a garlic clove in there and a slice of the beef
5. Fold it up into a ball and shove the whole thing down the hatch.

Before it goes in your pie-hole it should look like this ...
