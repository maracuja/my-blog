I've had this blog nearly two years now and this is the first attempt at describing how to make kimchi. It turns out it's like super easy.

_tl;dr You're basically salting some chinese cabbage and then covering it all in a chilli paste mix which preserves it._

## Ingredients

- 2x Chinese Cabbages
- Salt
- Ginger
- A daikon radish
- Garlic
- Sugar and a couple of cups of water (or a can of Spriteâ„¢)
- Chilli flakes

The quantities involved are for the chinese cabbages - I might have to try it myself and update them as whenever we've done it, it's been making enough for 12 people

## Salt the cabbage

1. Chop the Chinese cabbages in two and rub a healthy pile of salt into each one
2. Place them in a massive bowl and cover with water
3. Leave them like that overnight
4. Drain all the water and wash off the salt

When you're done you should end up with this ...

## Make the paste

You chop up the ginger and daikon into small matchstick-like pieces, mix it up with the chilli flakes and other stuff. You should end up with something like this ...

## Combine the cabbage and paste

This is the time consuming part, you have to get the paste and cover each leaf of each cabbage top to bottom with the paste. Just be warned, it takes ages and if you use too much paste or you don't cover all the leaves, you get told off

You should end up with this kind of sight before you ... mmmm looks ... amazing.

## Put it in a container and then leave it for a couple of days

You can eat it straight away, but it will be pretty crunchy and pretty spicy. If you leave it in the fridge for a couple of days, the spice kind of settles down and the cabbage softens up a little.
